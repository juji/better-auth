# Organization Implementation Plan for Next.js Client

This document outlines the plan to add comprehensive organization capabilities to the Next.js client, leveraging the Better Auth organization plugin that has been configured on the server.

## ðŸ“‹ Plan: create fake users

To create organizations, and to make it usable, first, we need to create multiple fake users.

This should be done on the hono server.

1. Create a data set that has 100 fakse users..
    check hono/src/lib/db/schema/auth.ts
    for the data fields...

2. create json containing 100 fake users

3. load the data into db
  



#### Organization Pages
```
app/(protected)/protected/organization/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Organization overview
â”œâ”€â”€ create/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx               # Create Organizations
â”œâ”€â”€ members/
