# Organization Implementation Plan for Next.js Client

This document outlines the plan to add comprehensive organization capabilities to the Next.js client, leveraging the Better Auth organization plugin that has been configured on the server.

## ðŸ“‹ Plan: create fake users

To create organizations, and to make it usable, first, we need to create multiple fake users.

This should be done on the hono server.

1. Create a data set that has 100 fake users..
    check hono/src/lib/db/schema/auth.ts
    for the data fields...

2. create sql containing 100 fake users

3. load the data into db, by creating a script

4. create script to remove those data as well.


## Create "Organization" Page 

app/(protected)/protected/organization/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Organization overview

In this page, we should be able to do CRUD operation on orgs.

## The Specific Organization Page 

app/(protected)/protected/organization/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Organization overview
â””â”€â”€ [slug]/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                # Specific Organizations

This is where we can find find details about org.

There's a link to manage users and teams

## The Users Management Page 

app/(protected)/protected/organization/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Organization overview
â””â”€â”€ [slug]/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                # Specific Organizations
    â””â”€â”€ users/
        â””â”€â”€ page.tsx            # Users Management


List all users, Add/remove user from org,
assign roles into users
add/remove users to/from team
invite user by email,
resend invitation email,


## The Team Management Page 

app/(protected)/protected/organization/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Organization overview
â””â”€â”€ [slug]/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                # Specific Organizations
    â””â”€â”€ users/
        â””â”€â”€ page.tsx            # Users Management
    â””â”€â”€ teams/
        â””â”€â”€ page.tsx            # Teams Management


List all team, Add/remove team,
